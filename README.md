# 2D-spin-demo
A demo to simulate 2D spin lattices with different shapes, boundary conditions, models and algorithms.

## installation
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run main.py to open the gui.  
Choose a combination of shape, boundary condition, model and algorithm as well as a grid size.  
Press initialize to create the grid.  
Press play to start and pause the demo. Use the sliders to adjust speed, temperature and model parameters.
